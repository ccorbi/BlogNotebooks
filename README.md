# PlayGround Code

Basacally my own Are 51, , here I post my first attempts with new toys and datasets. Experiments, some of them embarrasingly incomplete, but all of them  valuable learning experiences.

## On Progress


* 20170412_LSTM-pubmed-titles. Generating Titles for scientific Papers. Playing with LSTM, try to learn how to generate titles for pubmed papers. (playing with Keras) **ToDo** write a sampler, train the model with more data. Add embeddings to code the words. 

* 20171213_Interview_prediction. Predict candidates attendancy to interviews, Tried LogisticRegression, RandomForest and Bayeasin models, I did not get a mindblowing accuracity so far. **ToDo** Work a bit more in the feature enginiering, try some other approach to optimze model.

* 20180213_Items_Precies_predict. Prices Predictions. a example of a regression model, trying to predict prices using Keras. **ToDo** Work a bit more on features, try other models.

* 20180308_Monkeys_class. Identifying Monkeys. Learning pythorch. Build a classification model for monkey images. (Playing with pyTorch) **ToDo** try transfering learning, resnet50?

* 20180520_TPOT_with_Titanic. Testing TPOT, a automated Machine learning tool that optimizes machine learning pipleines using genetic programming. Using Kaggle competition on prediction of survival for passanger of the Titanic as a dummy example. **ToDo** I could work more on features, however this is pretty much done, I like TPOT!

## The Data Explorer Code


 Here you will find all the code and jupyter notebooks I used for the entries of [The Data Explorer](http://thedataexplorer.wordpress.com).

* [Face Generator](https://thedataexplorer.wordpress.com/2017/09/20/do-computers-have-imagination/) (2017/09/10). Using GANs to create a photorealistinc Face generator. [Training Video](https://youtu.be/4zIvMUd79lk)  (Playing with Keras)

* [Cooking Word2Vec](https://thedataexplorer.wordpress.com/2017/03/20/cooking-receipts-i/) (2017/03/19). Playing eith distributed word vectors (word2vec) for clustering cooking reciptes. next, build a predictor using the vectors as features. (playing with Gensim)
