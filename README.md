# PlayGround

Basically my own Are 51. Here I post my first attempts with new methods and datasets. Some these experiments are embarrassing incomplete, baby steps, but overa all a valuable learning experience.

## On Progress

* 20170412_LSTM-pubmed-titles. Generating Titles for scientific Papers. Playing with LSTM, try to learn how to generate titles for pubmed papers. (playing with Keras) **ToDo** write a sampler, train the model with more data. Add embeddings to code the words. 

* 20171213_Interview_prediction. Predict candidates attendance to interviews, Tried LogisticRegression, RandomForest, and Bayesian models, I did not get a mindblowing accuracy so far. **ToDo** Work a bit more in the feature engineering, try some other approach to optimize model.

* 20180213_Items_Precies_predict. Prices Predictions. An example of a regression model, trying to predict prices using Keras. **ToDo** Work a bit more on features, try other models.

* 20180308_Monkeys_class. Identifying Monkeys. Learning pythorch. Build a classification model for monkey images. (Playing with pyTorch) **ToDo** try transferring learning, resnet50?

* 20180120_VAE_cancer_clusters. Better clustering of cancer patients using Variational Autoencoders. (Pytorch) **ToDo** Improve validation.

* 20180213_Items_Precies_predict. Prices Predictions. a example of a regression model, trying to predict prices using Keras. **ToDo** Work a bit more on features, try other models.

## Almost Done

* 20180520_TPOT_with_Titanic. Testing TPOT, an automated Machine learning tool that optimizes machine learning pipelines using genetic programming. Using Kaggle competition on prediction of survival for passengers of the Titanic as a dummy example. **ToDo** I could work more on features, however, this is pretty much done, I like TPOT!


* 20180725_Smartlibrary_generator. Generator of peptides enforcing a concreate secondary structre using RNN (pytorch)



## The Data Explorer Code


 Here you will find all the code and Jupyter notebooks I used for the entries of [The Data Explorer](http://thedataexplorer.wordpress.com).

* [Face Generator](https://thedataexplorer.wordpress.com/2017/09/20/do-computers-have-imagination/) (2017/09/10). Using GANs to create a photorealistinc Face generator. [Training Video](https://youtu.be/4zIvMUd79lk)  (Playing with Keras)

* [Cooking Word2Vec](https://thedataexplorer.wordpress.com/2017/03/20/cooking-receipts-i/) (2017/03/19). Playing eith distributed word vectors (word2vec) for clustering cooking reciptes. next, build a predictor using the vectors as features. (playing with Gensim)
