# PlayGround Code

Basacally my own Are 51, , here I post my first attempts with new toys and datasets. Experiments, some of them embarrasingly incomplete, but all of them  valuable learning experiences.

## The Data Explorer Code

 Here you will find all the code and jupyter notebooks I used for the entries of [The Data Explorer](http://thedataexplorer.wordpress.com).

* Face Generator (2017/09/10). Using GANs to create a photorealistinc Face generator. (Playing with Keras)

* Cooking Word2Vec (2017/03/19). Playing eith distributed word vectors (word2vec) for clustering cooking reciptes. next, build a predictor using the vectors as features. (playing with Gensim)

## On Progress



* 20170412_LSTM-pubmed-titles. Generating Titles for scientific Papers. Playing with LSTM, try to learn how to generate titles for pubmed papers. (playing with Keras) **ToDo** write a sampler, train the model with more data. Add embeddings to code the words. 

* 20171213_Interview_prediction. Predict candidates attendancy to interviews, Tried LogisticRegression, RandomForest and Bayeasin models, I did not get a mindblowing accuracity so far. **ToDo** Work a bit more in the feature enginiering, try some other approach to optimze model.

* 20180213_Items_Precies_predict. Prices Predictions. a example of a regression model, trying to predict prices using Keras. **ToDo** Work a bit more on features, try other models.

* 20180308_Monkeys_class. Identifying Monkeys. Learning pythorch. Build a classification model for monkey images. (Playing with pyTorch) **ToDo** try transfering learning, resnet50?
