 Here you will find all the code and jupyter notebooks I used for the entries of [The Data Explorer](http://thedataexplorer.wordpress.com).

## Published 

* Face Generator (2017/09/10). Using GANs to create a photorealistinc Face generator. (Playing with Keras)

* Cooking Word2Vec (2017/03/19). Playing eith distributed word vectors (word2vec) for clustering cooking reciptes. next, build a predictor using the vectors as features. (playing with Gensim)

## On Progress

* identifying Monkeys. Learning pythorch. Build a classification model for monkey images. (Playing with pyTorch)

* Generating Titles. Playing with LSTM, try to learn how to generate titles for pubmed papers. (playing with Keras)

* Prices Predictions. a example of a regression model, trying to predict prices using Keras.
